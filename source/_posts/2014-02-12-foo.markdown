Today is my second day at [Hacker School](http://hackerschool.com), and I
decided to set up a little bit of tooling for blogging about what I do here.
The first tool I set up (following the recommendations of many Hacker Schoolers
and alums) was [Octopress](http://octopress.org), a static site generator
designed for [GitHub Pages](pages.github.com) and implemented atop
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). I followed the admirably thorough Octopress
documentation for [installation](http://octopress.org/docs/setup/),
[initial configuration](http://octopress.org/docs/configuring/),
[deployment with Github Pages](http://octopress.org/docs/deploying/github/), and
[theme customization](http://octopress.org/docs/theme/). But I wanted even more
convenience. So, I'm here to introduce you to the `blog` command.
